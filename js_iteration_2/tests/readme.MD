Use:
./full_test_suite.sh to compile and run all tests together (all cpp files in this immediate folder).

This folder contains several tests,
- all of them are xUnit-style tests.
- all of them share the same main function.
- all of them are compiled at the same time.
- none of the files individually have a main() function.
- Other tests such as performance tests, return experimentation, etc are in the sub folders.
- Files in sub-folders are not xUnit-stlye tests.

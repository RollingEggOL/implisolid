Three files:

ImpliSolid plan

mp5 plan
Designer plan
Others (WeDesign)
==========
mp5-slicer:
wedesign: We need a standalone version of slicer (in mp5slicer repo). It generates an STL from an mp5 file. The commandline should be like this (details may vary) 
mp5slice myfile.mp5 myfile.stl  #simple use
mp5slice myfile.mp5 -stl myfile.stl #complete
mp5slice myfile.mp5 -m myfile2.mp5 -stl myfile.stl #merges multiple files

mp5-format:
File bundle:
The idea is simlar to JAR files in java, and S?? files in SolidWorks.
multiple parts
parts that refer to eachother. For example primitives (standard shapes)

mp5-designer:
term: standard Object (or primitive)
term: Constraint
A geometric arrangement that become permanent.
term: lock-down:
The properties of an objects are constant. Even the overall rotation (matrix).
term: protected:
An object that can be moved, scaled, etc, but the inside infomration cannot be changed. Also the inside information is not visible to the user.
All standard objects (primitives) are protected.

term: matrix of an object.

matrices are hierarchical.
status: implemented (in designer, implisolid).
meaning:
useful for references, primitives.

term: refernce.
The references are not implemented.
This allows multiple instances of something.
Also an external refrence can be to anoterh person's object. (thorugh its mp5 unique ID).
Can be useful for using while not violating.

New license category:
can be used inside another object without modification. (referensable)

----------
mp5-implisolid:
we need an NPM library.

wedesign:
We can use MongoDB or couchDB for indexing the contents of MP5.
But the mp5 files should be stored as blobs, binaries, or files on the file system. Not directly on json-based databases. Instead, if indexing is neceessary, you can use for indexing purposes.
Reasons:
1- not goo to be updatable.
2- consistency is difficult.
3- it is against independence
4- contents of mp5 json may be changed for storage purposes.
5- We will want to radically change the format without changing the database's schema. 
6- independence.
7- People need to sownload the json. It is not good to dynamically generate the mp5 files. Because it may not be produced exactly in the same way.
8- hashing (md5) will not be possible.
history:
CouchDB was tried but decided not to be used. Contact Manon and Flavien Delangle for more information. 

mp5-format: yaml variation: is completely valid.
status: not implemented.

mp5-format: JSON-family of formats.
In fact all representations that are equivalent to JSON are valid. (which are yaml and json). Variations of JSON may be used in future, but a constaint is that, 
the mp5 contents should be easily readable by any langyuage tha provides the simples funcitons JSON.stringufy() and JSON.parse(). (for exmaple Python and Javascript
EJSON, etc: ?

In future decisions:
mp5 will remain a spearate file format. Not a format in databse, etc.
mp5 is doownloadable.
mp5 is usable in the exact same way (without any transformation) outside wedeisng or any platform.
For example some printers in future may want to ue it directly.
This is a high-priority decision and should be used in future. Contact SSi for this.

mp5-format:
Individual elements can include polygonisation settings.
as well as print-settings.

Question:
If two mp5 files with different print settings are merged (linked)?


mp5-implisolid:
Fonts support:
Progtress and research:
seach term: 


mp5-implisolid:
Ellipsoid SDF:
Summary of literature found:
https://www.spaceroots.org/documents/distance/distance-to-ellipse.pdf
ShaderToy.

mp5-implisolid:
a good developer communities:
shader-toy developers. Search SDF in shadertoy.

mp5-implisolid:
We need a guide for develoipers and developer-artists for easily using this. For example a tutorial. A displayer (interactive?). A commandline mesh generator. An STL generator. A web-based genrator.
WebWorker version, nont-web-worker JS version, server-side version, ..

GPU version (shader).
compile your mp5 into a shader code that is directly insertable into shadertoy.


designer ideas:
(also implisolid):
modelling-techniques.tex

Shamfer
Special points (specific for Cone, etc). Used by a key (string).


mp5-designer: refactor suggestion

mp5-designer:
that open modeller language.

small websites to showcase. in style of kovacsv/JSmodeler. and pathtrace.js.org

implisolid:
ways of modelling fonts.


implisolid:
"shell" operation.

quasi-"offset"

R-union

possibility of B-Rep remains open.



very important:
edges.
(1- special edges: customised.
2- sharp-edges, automatically)
* SVD of mesh, but confirm by the implicit function.
* Multi-implicit.



A 2D-implicit editing system, capable of fre form curves.

a curving transform to map it on certain (or all) shapes.
(cyclinder, sphere, etc; one for eahc).



Bloomenthal: Skeletal models & Implicit Blends (slides)



Priorities:
- trivar Splines
- Skeletal

- Screw+Twist+Kaleido+repeater+[infill-repeat]
(maybe escher?) + that round twisted Mobius sculpture

- Shell+offset+

- Harmonic
- Radial basis, hamilton, etc

Terms used instead of Implicit Modelling:
- RSDF, SDF, SARDF, ...
- antimony (also see thesis)
- Uformia
- (implicit skin) -(hudini muscle model) -...
- Layered-Depth-Normal-Image (LDNI)
- FRep/hyperfun, shapeshop, ...
- genral: implicitcad,
- ASDF (see Antimony)
- 



External literatures:
- Reservoir modelling
- PDE/Fluid modelling (Persson)
- Medical imaging: MRI, UltraSound, etc
- Computer vision: 3d (NN, convoilution-volumes)


Nice examples from:
- Bloomenthal's skeletal.
- Antomony's solids.
- ...
